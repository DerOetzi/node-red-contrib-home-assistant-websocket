# Fire Event

The Fire Event node allows you to fire an event on the Home Assistant event bus. This can be used to trigger automations or notify other parts of the system about specific occurrences. Itâ€™s a way to programmatically generate events that other nodes or systems can listen to and react upon.

## Configuration

### Event <Badge text="required"/>

- Type: `string`

Event name to fire

### data

- Type: `Object`

JSON object to pass along

## Inputs

If the incoming message has a `payload` property with `event` set it will override any config values if set.
If the incoming message has a `payload.data` that is an object or parsable into an object these properties will be **merged** with any config values set.
If the node has a property value in its config for `Merge Context` then the `flow` and `global` contexts will
be checked for this property which should be an object that will also be merged
into the data payload.

### payload.event

- Type: `string`

Event to fire

### payload.data

- Type: `Object`

Event data to send

## Outputs

### payload.event_type

- Type: `string`

Event Type that was fired

### payload.data

- Type: `Object`

The event `data` sent if one was used
