# Switch

The Switch node creates a switch entity within Home Assistant that can be controlled from Node-RED. This node also allows a flow to be started from a service call, making it a versatile tool for both controlling devices and triggering automations.

## Configuration

### Enable input

Input is disabled by default. It can be enabled by checking this option.

### Output on state change

- Type: `boolean`

When the state of the switch changes it will output to the top if the switch is on or to the bottom if it is in the off position.

## Inputs

### msg.enable

- Type: `boolean`

Set to `true` to turn on the switch and `false` to turn it off. If the message has a property `enable` defined and set to a `boolean` the node will not have any output.

## Outputs

**Status Color**

- Green/Red: output from the node was due to input to the node
- Blue: output from the node was due to the state of the node changing
- Yellow: state of node changed but no output
